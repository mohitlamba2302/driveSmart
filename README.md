# driveSmart
The future of Indian Cars

## Hardware Requirements:
 - Arduino Uno
 - Heart Rate sensor
 -camera Module with USB
 -ESP-32 module

## Working:
The hardware is set-up on the steering wheel of the driver and collects data of driver through sensors
The data collected is sent to the cloud using and ESP-32 wifi module attached with the Microcontroller.
The Random Forrest classifier Model predicts the safetly ratio of the driver using the input parameters everysecond, and sends a realtime signal to the customer phone of whether the driver is driving safe or not.
