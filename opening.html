	<h3>The problem:</h3>
	<p>The taxi services in India are taking over most of the travellers in the country to opt for their services, by
providing good facilities such as real time tracking, highly maintained cars, 24 hr. service, competitive fair.
It definitely looks like a better alternative for running errands in the hustle of the city, specially
metropolitan cities on a public transport with weather conditions so unfavourable and population so
dense that one cannot multitask while travelling. But are those cab services that we use actually worth
that much trust? Let’s find out…</p>

<h3>The Initiative:</h3>
<p>The project makes an attempt to make taxi services in India smarter and safer. The main purpose of the project focuses on the driver of a car. The insurance companies may protect the passengers from the accidental damages but what if there are alert systems and real time monitoring of the driver who has the control of the car. Along with monitoring the results of the driver and response be shared with the passenger so that he/she could easily choose if they wish to reject the driver and book another one, or carry on with the present condition.</p>

<h3>Target Audience:</h3>
<p>The main purpose of the project will be to develop a finished product ready to install in cars and commercial vehicles that can allow the drivers be alerted if any unforeseen circumstance if witnessed. The product can be demonstrated to the government as a safety enhancement toolkit that can be made mandatory for car companies to fit in any vehicle sold.</p>

<h3>Future Aspects: </h3>
<p>The microcontroller will take input from all the sensor and sent the data to the local cloud where features such as rash driving, drunk driving, smoking and other unhealthy driving conditions will be detected and concerned authorities will be reported and such accidental cases will be taken care of long before any of it actually happens. We will be attaching temperature sensor ( LM35), motion sensor (gyroscope), smoke detectors (MQ-2), alcohol sensors(TGS822),  etc..
